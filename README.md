In this project I created a desktop app with QT and SQLight.

A user will be able to give their own csv file to load their own deck into the application.  
From here the user can interact with the GUI to ask for the probability of drawing certain cards and notify the program which cards have been drawn to show accurate probabilities.

SQLight was used to show it interacts with a virtually created database.
